          Demineralization Plants (DM Plants) are advanced water purification systems designed to remove dissolved salts and minerals through ion exchange processes. These systems are crucial in industries where ultra-pure water is required, such as pharmaceuticals, power generation, and electronics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          At Varsha Enviro Technologies, our DM plants ensure the production of high-quality demineralized water with minimal operational costs and long service life. The process involves strong acid cation and strong base anion exchange resins, delivering water with conductivity as low as 0.1 ÂµS/cm.
